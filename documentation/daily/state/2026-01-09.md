# State for 2026-01-09.

- Current: Devcontainer build now supports explicit Ansible toolchain version pinning via `ANSIBLE_CORE_VERSION`, `ANSIBLE_LINT_VERSION`, and `YAMLLINT_VERSION` build args.
- Current: `/.devcontainer/scripts/env-loader.sh` debug mode reports newly added env var names more accurately (optional value printing via `ENV_LOADER_DEBUG_VALUES=1`).
- Current: Starship prompt shows `PROJECT_NAME@CONTAINER_HOSTNAME` when `CONTAINER_HOSTNAME` is set.
- Current: Added ADRs documenting `documentation/daily/` journaling, devcontainer `.env` configuration, SSH agent forwarding, and pinned Ansible tooling.
- Current: Root `/Dockerfile` also fails fast if Ansible toolchain version vars are missing.
- Next: Rebuild the devcontainer image so the pinned tool versions take effect.
