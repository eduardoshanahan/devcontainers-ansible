# State for 2026-01-07.

- Devcontainer Ansible paths now come from host environment variables.
- Devcontainer workspace folder/mount target is host-driven via WORKSPACE_FOLDER.
- README notes updated to document host-driven Ansible path variables.
- Added WORKSPACE_FOLDER and ANSIBLE_* variables to .env and .env.example.
- SSH agent forwarding now mounts the host socket at /ssh-agent and sets SSH_AUTH_SOCK accordingly.
- Added SSH_AUTH_SOCK to .env and fail-fast checks for missing socket in post-create.
- Enforced required environment validation in post-create for GIT_USER_NAME, GIT_USER_EMAIL, ANSIBLE_*, PROJECT_NAME, WORKSPACE_FOLDER, DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME, DOCKER_IMAGE_TAG, and CONTAINER_*.
- Devcontainer image tagging now uses DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME:DOCKER_IMAGE_TAG.
- Reordered .env.example so EDITOR_CHOICE precedes CONTAINER_HOSTNAME to avoid empty expansion.
- Fixed CONTAINER_CPUS validation regex so decimal values are accepted.
- Moved VS Code terminal settings under customizations.vscode.settings in devcontainer.json.
- Updated devcontainer-launch.sh to use a CLI session id label, build the image explicitly, and skip Claude install.
- Updated claude-launch.sh to use a session id label and build the image explicitly.
- Added LOCALE build arg/env and shutdownAction in devcontainer.json; removed pinned Ansible versions from the image build.
- Added the anthropic.claude-code VS Code extension to devcontainer.json.
- Added LOCALE to .env and .env.example.
- Added LOCALE and SSH_AUTH_SOCK validation to the devcontainer env validator.
- Hardened Claude Code install in post-create with download + optional checksum.
- Documented optional CLAUDE_INSTALL_SHA256 in .env files and validated it when set.
- Made locale setup in the devcontainer Dockerfile strict (requires LOCALE and updates locale.gen).
- Added devcontainer entrypoint script to run post-stop logic.
- Removed colors-raw.sh (not needed).
- No tests run in this change.
