## Plan

- Add Docker presence/daemon checks to CLI launcher scripts for clearer failures.
- Add devcontainer image cleanup script and documentation.
- Rename scripts to use hyphenated names and update references.
- Add root docs for troubleshooting, sync-git, devcontainer CLI, and Claude.
- Rename launch.sh to editor-launch.sh and update references.
- Move documentation into documentation/ and update links.
- Add file sync and ownership documentation.
- Show project name in the devcontainer prompt via Starship config.
- Ensure Starship loads the repo config and add an arrow separator.
- Record updates in lm/state and lm/recaps.
