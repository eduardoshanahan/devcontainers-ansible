# Recap for 2026-01-07.

- Switched devcontainer ANSIBLE_* paths to host-driven env vars.
- Made the devcontainer workspace folder and mount target host-driven via WORKSPACE_FOLDER.
- Updated README notes to document host-driven Ansible path variables.
- Added WORKSPACE_FOLDER and ANSIBLE_* entries to .env and .env.example.
- Mounted the host SSH agent socket into the devcontainer and set SSH_AUTH_SOCK to /ssh-agent.
- Added SSH_AUTH_SOCK to .env and made post-create fail if the socket is missing.
- Enforced required environment validation in post-create for Git identity, ANSIBLE_*, project, docker image, and container resource variables.
- Wired DOCKER_IMAGE_TAG into the devcontainer image name.
- Reordered .env.example so EDITOR_CHOICE is defined before CONTAINER_HOSTNAME.
- Fixed CONTAINER_CPUS validation regex to accept decimals like 2.5.
- Moved VS Code terminal settings under customizations.vscode.settings in devcontainer.json.
- Updated devcontainer-launch.sh to label CLI sessions, build images explicitly, and skip Claude install.
- Updated claude-launch.sh to label sessions and build images explicitly.
- Added LOCALE build arg/env and shutdownAction to devcontainer.json; removed pinned Ansible versions from the image build.
- Added the anthropic.claude-code VS Code extension to devcontainer.json.
- Added LOCALE to .env and .env.example.
- Added LOCALE and SSH_AUTH_SOCK validation to the devcontainer env validator.
- Hardened Claude Code install in post-create with download + optional checksum.
- Documented optional CLAUDE_INSTALL_SHA256 in .env files and validated it when set.
- Made locale setup in the devcontainer Dockerfile strict (requires LOCALE and updates locale.gen).
- Added devcontainer entrypoint script to run post-stop logic.
- Removed colors-raw.sh (not needed).
