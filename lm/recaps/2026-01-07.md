- Switched devcontainer ANSIBLE_* paths to host-driven env vars.
- Made the devcontainer workspace folder and mount target host-driven via WORKSPACE_FOLDER.
- Updated README notes to document host-driven Ansible path variables.
- Added WORKSPACE_FOLDER and ANSIBLE_* entries to .env and .env.example.
- Mounted the host SSH agent socket into the devcontainer and set SSH_AUTH_SOCK to /ssh-agent.
- Added SSH_AUTH_SOCK to .env and made post-create fail if the socket is missing.
- Enforced required environment validation in post-create for Git identity, ANSIBLE_*, project, docker image, and container resource variables.
